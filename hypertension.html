        <h class="h2">What is Hypertension</h>
        <p class="explainp"> 
            Blood pressure is the force that a person’s blood exerts against the walls of their blood vessels. This pressure depends on the resistance of the blood vessels and how hard the heart has to work. Narrow <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/arteries-of-the-body">arteries</a> create more resistance for blood flow out of the heart. The narrower your arteries, the more resistance there is, and the higher your blood pressure will be. Over the long term, the increased pressure can cause health issues, including <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease">heart disease.</a><br>


Hypertension typically develops over several years, usually without causing any symptoms. But even without symptoms, high blood pressure can cause damage to your blood vessels and organs, especially the brain, heart, eyes, and kidneys.<br>

Early detection is important. Regular blood pressure readings can help you and a doctor notice any changes. If your blood pressure is elevated, a doctor may have you <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/how-to-check-blood-pressure-by-hand">check your blood pressure </a>over a few weeks to see if the number stays elevated or falls back to typical levels.<br>

Treatment for hypertension includes both prescription medication and healthy lifestyle changes. Without treatment, it could lead to health issues, including heart attack and stroke.<br>
        
      
</p>
<img class="pic1" src="health2.jpeg" alt="">

<p class="explainp">    Your blood pressure reading consists of two numbers:
<ul class="bp"style="margin-top:2px;" >
  <li><strong>Systolic pressure (top number):</strong> the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and pumps out blood
</li>  
   <li><strong>Diastolic pressure (bottom number):</strong> the pressure in your arteries between beats of your heart</li> 
</ul>

</p>




<h class="h2">What causes high blood pressure?</h>

<p class="explainp">
  
There are two types of hypertension. Each type has a different cause.<br>
</p>
<h class="h4">Essential (primary) hypertension</h><br>
<p class="explainp">
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/essential-hypertension">Essential hypertension,</a> also called primary hypertension, develops over time. Most people have this type of high blood pressure.

A combination of factors typically play a role in the development of essential hypertension:<br>
<ul class="bp">
<li>    
<strong>Genes:</strong> Some people are <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/familial-hypertension">genetically predisposed</a> to hypertension. This may be from gene mutations or inherited from your parents.</li>
<li>
<strong>Age:</strong> People over 65 years old are more at risk for hypertension.</li>

<li>
<strong>Race:</strong> Black people have a higher incidence of hypertension in the United States. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9838393/">Research</a> suggests that systemic, cultural, and genetic factors contribute to this inequity.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Living a sedentary lifestyle:</strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7700832/">Sedentary behaviors</a> have links to several cardiovascular issues, including hypertension.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Living with diabetes or metabolic syndrome:</strong> People diagnosed with either <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes/hypertension">diabetes</a> or metabolic syndrome
 are at a higher risk of developing hypertension.</li>
<li>
<strong>Living with obesity:</strong> Living with <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/obesity-and-hypertension">obesity</a> can lead to a few cardiovascular issues, including hypertension.
</li>
<li><strong>High alcohol consumption:</strong> <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.123.21224">Research</a> shows that even one drink per day can increase your risk of hypertension, with higher alcohol consumption further increasing your risk.    
    
</li>
<li>
<strong>High sodium intake:</strong> There’s a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770596/">close link</a> between daily high <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/sodium-per-day">sodium intake</a> (more than 5 grams a day) and hypertension.
</li>
</ul></p>
      
      
   
  <h class="h4">Secondary Hypertension</h><br>
<p class="explainp">    
Secondary hypertension often occurs quickly and can become more severe than primary hypertension. Several conditions that may cause secondary hypertension include:<br>
<ul class="bp" style="margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;">
<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hypertension-and-kidney-disease-ten-signs">kidney disease</a></li>
<li>obstructive sleep apnea</li>
<li>structural heart issues present from birth</li>
<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/common-thyroid-disorders">problems with your thyroid</a></li>
<li>adrenal gland problems</li>
<li>certain endocrine tumors</li>
 </ul>    
     
     
      
      </p>
      
       <p class="explainp">
           Over 1 billion people around the world have high blood pressure. It is <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/blood-pressure-reading-explained">defined as</a> systolic blood pressure (SBP) values (the top number) of 130 mm Hg or more, diastolic blood pressure (DBP, the bottom number) of more than 80 mm Hg, or both.

Lifestyle changes and dietary modifications can also help lower blood pressure levels and reduce your risk of heart disease. Doctors may also prescribe medications to reduce blood pressure levels, including <a href="https://www.healthline.com/wp-admin/text=5.,to%20let%20more%20blood%20through.">angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.</a>

Including <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension/lower-it-fast">certain foods</a> in your diet, especially ones in potassium and magnesium, may help lower your blood pressure levels.
       </p>
      <br>
      <h class="h4">
         1. Citrus fruit</h>
          <p class="explainp">
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/citrus-fruit-benefits">Citrus fruits</a> may help lower blood pressure. They’re loaded with vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds, that could help keep your heart healthy by reducing risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure.

Citrus fruits can include:

<ul class="bp" style="margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;">
  <li>Oranges</li>
<li>grapefruit</li>
<li>lemons</li>
</ul>
</p>
    
      <p class="explainp">    
A 2021 study reviewed the last 10 years of information on fruit and management of high blood pressure. The researchers found that eating roughly 530 to 600 grams of fruit per day (about four oranges) was beneficial for blood pressure management. Researchers have linked citrus fruits, in particular with a lower possibility of high blood pressure.

Drinking orange and grapefruit juice may help reduce blood pressure. But grapefruit and grapefruit juice can <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/grapefruit-and-medications">interfere</a> with common medications for lowering blood pressure, so consult a healthcare professional before adding this fruit to your diet.
</p><br>
<h class="h4">2. Salmon and other fatty fish</h>
 <p class="explainp">
Fatty fish are an excellent <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-omega-3-rich-foods">source of omega-3 fats,</a> which have significant heart benefits. These fats may help reduce blood pressure levels by <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/omega-3-guide">lowering inflammation.</a><br>

A 2022 study looked at 71 studies and health information from 4,973 people to determine the relationship between omega-3 fats from the diet or supplements and blood pressure. The largest benefit for lowering blood pressure occurred with a daily amount between 2 to 3 grams of omega-3 fats (about a 3.5-ounce serving of salmon).<br>

Higher omega-3 fat levels in the diet, including fish, may also lower the risk of high blood pressure in young adults with no history of heart disease or diabetes.


     </p>
      
      <br>
      
     <h class="h4">3. Leafy greens</h>
           
      <p class="explainp">
      
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/swiss-chard">Swiss chard</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/spinach">spinach</a> are two examples of leafy greens that may help lower blood pressure.

These leafy greens are a source of the nutrients such as <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/potassium"><potassium</a> and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/what-does-magnesium-do">magnesium,</a> which support optimal blood pressure levels. For instance, 1 cup (175 grams) of cooked Swiss chard delivers 20% and 36% of your daily potassium and magnesium needs, respectively.<br>

A 2022 study found that among females with high sodium levels from their diet, every 1 gram increase in daily potassium from the diet was linked with a 2.4 mm Hg lower SBP.<br>

Spinach is a leafy green high in a plant-based compound known as <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/are-nitrates-and-nitrites-harmful">nitrate,</a> which may lower blood pressure. It’s also loaded with antioxidants, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which can support heart health.<br>

An older, small study of 27 people found that those who ate 16.9 ounces (500 milliliters) of a high nitrate spinach soup daily for 7 days experienced reductions in both SBP and DBP, compared with those who consumed low nitrate asparagus soup.

More recent clinical research does not show a similar effect of high-nitrate leafy greens on lowering BP, so additional studies are needed to further explore these results.

    
      </p>
      <br>
     <h class="h4">4. Nuts and seeds</h>
         
      <p class="explainp">
          Nuts and seeds may have a beneficial effect on blood pressure. Examples of nuts and seeds to eat as part of a balanced diet focused on lowering blood pressure include:
<ul class="bp" style="margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;">
    <li>
pumpkin seeds</li><li>
flaxseed</li><li>
chia seed</li><li>
pistachios</li><li>
walnuts</li><li>
almonds</li>
    </ul>
       
   </p>  
       
      <p class="explainp"> 
Many nuts and seeds offer a concentrated source of nutrients important for blood pressure control, including fiber and arginine. Arginine is an amino acid needed to produce nitric oxide, an essential compound for blood vessel relaxation and blood pressure reduction.<br>

While some research shows a positive relationship between eating nuts or seeds and lower blood pressure, the evidence is mixed in clinical studies.<br>

Scientists believe the conflicting results could be because clinical studies involving nuts or seeds and blood pressure measurements might be too short in time to identify any potential effects on lowering blood pressure.<br>

Longer studies may help researchers better understand how nuts or seeds may lower blood pressure.
</p>
<br>
<h class="h4">5. Legumes</h>
    
      <p class="explainp">
Legumes are rich in nutrients that help regulate blood pressure, such as magnesium and potassium. Numerous observational studies suggest legumes may help lower high blood pressure levels.

Legumes include:<br>
<ul class="bp" style="margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;">
 <li>lentils</li>
 <li>beans</li>
 <li>peas</li>
 </ul>
 </p>
     
      <p class="explainp">
But a 2023 review of 16 clinical studies found no relationship between eating legumes and lowered blood pressure levels. The authors suggest that additional studies that are larger and longer may help explain how legumes correlate with lower blood pressure in other studies.


      </p>
      <br>
      <h class="h4"> 6. Broccoli</h>
      <p class="explainp">
        
Broccoli is known for its many beneficial effects on health, including the health of your circulatory system. For example, adding this cruciferous veggie to your diet may be a smart way to reduce blood pressure.<br>

Broccoli is loaded with flavonoid antioxidants, which may help lower blood pressure by enhancing blood vessel function and increasing nitric oxide levels in your body.<br>

A study that included data from 187,453 people found that those who consumed four broccoli servings or more per week had a lower likelihood of high blood pressure than those who consumed broccoli once a month or less.
</p>
<br>
    
    
          
      <h class="h4"> 7. Eggs</h>
      <p class="explainp">
         
Not only are <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/6-reasons-why-eggs-are-the-healthiest-food-on-the-planet">eggs </a>nutrient-dense but <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/proven-health-benefits-of-eggs">research</a> also suggests that they can be part of a balanced eating plan for blood pressure management.

A 2023 study among 2,349 adults in the United States found that eating five eggs or more per week was linked with an SBP level that was 2.5 mm Hg lower than people who ate less than half of an egg per week. Egg eaters also had a significantly lower likelihood of developing high blood pressure over the long term.

Eating eggs also does not appear to be linked with other risk factors for heart disease beyond blood pressure, and the latest evidence seems to support adults in good health <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/proven-health-benefits-of-eggs">eating up to 3 eggs per day.</a>
      </p><br>
    
          
      <h class="h4"> 8. Olive oil</h>
      <p class="explainp">
          
         
The oil from the fruit of the olive tree has numerous health benefits, including lowering blood pressure and other risk factors for heart disease.

A 2020 review of studies found that due to the nutrients and plant-based compounds in olive oil, such as the omega-9 fat oleic acid and antioxidant polyphenols, it can be a beneficial part of a diet that aims to lower blood pressure.
</p>

<h class="h4">9. Carrots</h>
<p class="explainp">
Crunchy, sweet, and nutritious carrots are a staple veggie in many people’s diets. Carrots are high in plant-based compounds that may be involved in various health processes, such as managing blood pressure.

A 2023 study found that the possibility of high blood pressure went down 10% for roughly every 100 grams of carrots (about 1 cup of grated raw carrots) eaten daily.
      </p><br>
      <h class="h4">10. Herbs and spices </h>
      <p class="explainp">
      
Certain <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-healthy-herbs-and-spices">herbs and spices</a> contain powerful compounds that may help reduce blood pressure by helping blood vessels relax.

Some herbs and spices that may help lower blood pressure according to results from animal and human research include:<br></p>
<ul class="bp" style="margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;">
<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/black-pepper-benefits">black pepper</a></li>
<li><a href="index.html">garlic</a></li>

<li>chili powder</li>
<li>red pepper</li>
<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-ginger">ginger</a></li>
<li>cinnamon</li>
<li>Tumeric</li>
<li>celery seed</li>
<li>cilantro</li>
<li>saffron</li>
<li>lemongrass</li>
<li>oregano</li>
<li>cumin</li>
<li>guava leaves</li>
<li>ovacado seed</li>
<li>cardamom</li>
<li>basil</li>
</ul>
<p class="explainp">
More recently, a 2021 study on 71 people with risk factors for heart disease found that seasoning foods with 6.6 grams (1.3 teaspoons) of 24 different herbs and spices daily was linked to lower blood pressure after 4 weeks when compared with lower dosages of herbs and spices (3.3 grams/day and 0.5 grams/day). 
      </p><br>
          
      <h class="h4"> 11. Berries</h>
      <p class="explainp">
        
Berries offer impressive health benefits, including the potential to reduce heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure. Berries are a rich source of antioxidants, including anthocyanins, which are pigments that give berries their vibrant color.<br>

Anthocyanins can increase nitric oxide levels in the blood and reduce the production of molecules that restrict blood flow. This may help lower blood pressure levels. But more research in humans is needed to confirm this.<br>

Some berries that may reduce blood pressure include:<br>
<ul class="bp" style="margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;">
<li>blueberries</li>
<li>raspberries</li>
<li>chokeberries</li>
<li>strawberries</li>
<li>grapes</li>
<li>cranberries</li>
</ul>
<p class="explainp">
A 2020 review of clinical studies found various types of berries, including whole, freeze-dried, or juice forms, reduced SBP by over 3 mm Hg. The strongest effect on SBP in this study was for cranberry juice.
      </p><br>
    <h class="h4">12. Yogurt</h>
    <p class="explainp">
          
Yogurt is a nutrient-dense dairy product packed with minerals that help regulate blood pressure, including potassium and calcium.

A review of 28 studies found that consuming three servings of dairy per day was linked with a 13% lower possibility of high blood pressure, as well as that a 7-ounce (200 gram) increase in the amount of dairy eaten per day had a relationship with a 5% reduction in risk for high blood pressure.<br>

A 2021 study also showed that among people with high blood pressure, having a serving of yogurt per day was linked with lower SBP levels. No effects were found for people with blood pressure in the typical levels.<br>

The researchers suggest that increasing daily yogurt consumption by one level was linked with a 1.44 mm Hg reduction in SBP. For example, increasing the daily amount of yogurt you eat from 2 to 4 times per week to 5 to 6 times per week may benefit people with high blood pressure.          
      </p><br>
    
    <h class="h4"> 
     13. Potatoes  
    </h>
    <p class="explainp">
        
Potatoes have several <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/potatoes">plant-based compounds</a> that could be useful in managing blood pressure levels.

A baked medium potato (173 grams) with the skin contains 941 milligrams of potassium. This is 20% of your daily requirement and more than a medium banana provides.

A 2021 study fed 30 adults at high risk for or with high blood pressure four possible diets, including one diet with 1,000 milligrams of potassium from potatoes (boiled, baked, pan-heated), for 17 days.

At the end of the study, the researchers concluded that the diet with potatoes reduced SBP as part of an overall healthy diet providing roughly 3,300 milligrams of potassium per day.
        </p><br>
    
    
    <h class="h4">14. Tomatoes</h>
    <p class="explainp">
         
Tomatoes and tomato products are rich in many nutrients, including potassium and the carotenoid pigment <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lycopene">lycopene.</a>

Lycopene has been significantly linked with beneficial effects on heart health, and eating foods high in this nutrient may help reduce heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure.

A review of 21 studies concluded that consuming tomato and tomato products improves blood pressure and may help reduce your chance of heart disease and dying from heart disease (27).

Additional studies have shown an inconsistent relationship between a diet with tomatoes and blood pressure, so more clinical studies may be needed.
    </p><br>
    
    
    
    
    
    
<h class="h4">15. Kiwifruit</h>  
    <p class="explainp">
        
<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/kiwi-benefits">Kiwifruit</a> is exceptionally high in vitamin C and contains other nutrients involved in blood pressure regulation, including fiber, potassium, and magnesium.

They also provide various plant-based polyphenol and antioxidant compounds. That’s why researchers believe kiwifruit could help lower risk factors for heart disease, including blood pressure.

A 2022 study of 43 healthy Asian adults from New Zealand found that eating two kiwis at breakfast every day for 7 weeks resulted in a 2.7 mm Hg lower SBP than the group not eating kiwifruit.

Additional research with more people over longer periods of time may help confirm the role kiwi could play in helping lower blood pressure.

    <h class="h4">
          16. Lean meats
    </h>  
    <p class="explainp">
      
The United States Department of Agriculture defines “lean meat” as any meat with less than 10 grams of fat, 4.5 grams or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 100 grams (about a 3.5-ounce serving).

<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lean-protein-foods">Lean animal proteins</a> might include any of the following meat or poultry foods that provide high quality protein and nutrients involved in blood pressure management:
</p>

<ul class="bp"style="margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;">
<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/calories-in-chicken">skinless chicken breast</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/beef">beef sirloin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/pork">pork tenderloin</a></li>
<li>93% lean ground turkey</li>
</ul>
<p class="explainp">
An older study with a small sample of older adults with elevated blood pressure found that when lean pork was substituted for chicken or fish in a modified <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/dash-diet">DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension)</a> diet for 6 weeks, it lowered blood pressure comparable to a more traditional DASH diet.

Research from scientists in China supports varying your protein sources for a lower possibility of developing high blood pressure. Of eight possible different protein sources, including unprocessed red meat and poultry, people with the highest variety score (four different proteins or higher) had a 66% lower chance of developing high blood pressure.

Lean meats can be part of a balanced eating plan for lowering blood pressure if they meet your personal taste, budgetary, and cultural food needs

    <h class="h4">What are the effects of high blood pressure on the body?</h> 
  <p class="explainp">
Because hypertension is often a silent condition, it can cause damage to your body for years before symptoms become obvious. Without treatment, you may face serious, even fatal, complications.<br>

Hypertension can damage your arteries, making them tougher, tighter, and less elastic. This damage makes it easier for deposits to collect in your arteries and restrict blood flow through your body, affecting multiple systems.

Complications of hypertension include:
<br>
<ul class="bp" style="margin-top:2px;margin-bottom:2px;">
<li>stroke</li>
<li>heart attack</li>
<li>heart failure</li>
<li>arrhythmia</li>
<li>sudden cardiac death</li>
<li>kidney disease or failure</li>
<li>vision loss</li>
<li>sexual dysfunction</li>
<li>cognitive issues, including dementia</li>
