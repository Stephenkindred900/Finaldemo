 Ginger may have numerous health benefits due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-nausea, and other properties. It may help you lose weight, manage arthritis, reduce menstrual symptoms, and more.

Ginger comes from a flowering plant originating in Southeast Asia. It adds flavor to sweet and savory foods and has a range of health benefits. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, and it’s closely related to turmeric, cardamom, and galangal.

The rhizome (underground part of the stem) is the part commonly used as a spice. It’s often called ginger root or, simply, ginger.

You can use ginger fresh, dried, powdered, or as an oil or juice. It features in many recipes as well as processed foods, home remedies, and cosmetics.

              <p class="h5">Health Benefits</p>
         <p class="benefitsph">1. Contains gingerol, which has potent medicinal properties

</p>
        <p  class="explainp">
 Ginger has a long history of use in various forms of traditional and alternative medicine. It’s been used to aid digestion, reduce nausea, and help fight the flu and common cold, to name a few of its purposes.

The unique fragrance and flavor of ginger come from its natural oils, the most important of which is gingerol.

Gingerol is the main bioactive compound in ginger. It’s responsible for many of ginger’s medicinal properties.

Gingerol has powerful anti-inflammatory and <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained">antioxidant</a> effects, according to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9654013/">research.</a> For instance, it may help reduce oxidative stress, which results from having too many free radicals in the body.
        </p><br>
        
        
         <p class="benefitsph">
2. May lower blood sugar and improve heart disease risk factors
         </p>
        <p  class="explainp">

Some research suggests ginger may have anti-diabetic properties.

In a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4277626/">2015 study,</a> 41 people with <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/type-2-diabetes">type 2 diabetes</a> took 2 grams of ginger powder per day.

A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35031435/">2022 review</a> found a significant reduction in fasting blood sugar and HbA1c in people with type 2 diabetes after taking ginger supplements.

The review looked at results from 10 trials, in which participants took 1,200–3,000 milligrams (mg) per day for 8–13 weeks.


A high apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio and high levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) can result from oxidative stress, a byproduct of oxidative stress. They are both risk factors for <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease">heart disease.</a>

        </p><br>
        
        
        <p class="benefitsph">3. May help lower cholesterol levels</p>
        <p  class="explainp">

High levels of LDL (bad) <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/ldl-cholesterol">cholesterol</a> are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33186534/">linked to</a> an increased risk of heart disease.

In a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36165525/">2022 review</a> of 26 trials, researchers found that ginger consumption significantly reduced triglycerides and LDL cholesterol, while increasing HDL cholesterol. Even doses less than 1,500 mg per day were effective.

However, it may be hard to include such high doses of ginger in your diet, particularly if you don’t like the taste of ginger.

        </p><br>
        
        
        <p class="benefitsph">4. May help reduce cancer risk</p>
        <p  class="explainp">
            
Ginger may have anticancer properties due to gingerol and various other antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds.

There is some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369959/">evidence</a> that these compounds may help reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancers, such as colorectal, pancreatic, and liver cancer.

In <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3618532/">one study</a>, 20 people with a high risk of colorectal cancer took 2 g of ginger daily for 28 days. At the end of the study, the lining of the participant’s intestines showed fewer cancer-like changes than expected.

However, most studies relating to ginger and cancer risk have not involved humans.
        </p><br>
        
        <p class="benefitsph">5. Can help fight infections</p>
        <p  class="explainp">
Ginger’s antimicrobial properties could make it useful for fighting bacterial and fungal infections.

Laboratory <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844022017455">studies</a> have found it may be effective against:

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), which is responsible for a range of diseases
Escherichia coli (E. coli), a cause of intestinal infections
Candida albicans (C. albicans), which causes fungal infections in the mouth, vagina, and so on</p><br>
        
        
        
          <p class="benefitsph">6. Can help treat chronic indigestion</p>
        <p  class="explainp">
 
Ginger may help manage <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/indigestion">indigestion</a> by speeding up the passage of food through the stomach.

Functional dyspepsia is when a person has indigestion — with symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, feeling too full, belching, and nausea — for no clear reason. It often occurs with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

In one study, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4411465/">scientists</a> found that consuming a ginger and artichoke preparation before eating a main meal significantly improved the symptoms of indigestion in people with functional dyspepsia, compared with taking a placebo.
        </p><br>
        
          <p class="benefitsph">7. Can treat morning sickness and other forms of nausea</p>
        <p  class="explainp">

Ginger may be effective against nausea, including pregnancy-related nausea, commonly known as morning sickness.

Ginger may help relieve nausea and vomiting for people undergoing certain types of surgery, and it may also help reduce chemotherapy-related nausea.


Ginger may not be suitable during pregnancy for people who are close to labor and those with a history of pregnancy loss or vaginal bleeding. It may also be unsuitable for those with clotting disorders</p><br>
