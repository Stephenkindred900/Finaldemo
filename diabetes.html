        <h class="h2">What is Diabetes</h>
        <p class="explainp">Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Glucose is your body’s main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but glucose also comes from the food you eat.
<a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/I/insulin">Insulin</a> is a <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/H/hormone">hormone</a> made by the <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/P/pancreas">pancreas</a> that helps glucose get into your cells to be used for energy. If you have diabetes, your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin, or doesn’t use insulin properly. Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.

Diabetes raises the risk for damage to the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. Diabetes is also linked to some types of cancer. Taking steps to prevent or manage diabetes may lower your risk of developing diabetes health problems.

       <h class="h3">Types of Diabetes</h><br>
       <h class="h4">Type 1 Diabetes</h>
       <p class="explainp">If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. Your <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/Dictionary/I/immune-system">immune system</a> attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin every day to stay alive.</p>
        
        <h class="h4">Type 2 Diabetes</h>
        <p class="explainp">If you have <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/type-2-diabetes">type 2 diabetes,</a> the cells in your body don’t use insulin properly. The pancreas may be making insulin but is not making enough insulin to keep your blood glucose level in the normal range. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. You are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you have <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/risk-factors-type-2-diabetes">risk factors,</a> such as overweight or obesity, and a family history of the disease. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood.

You can help delay or <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/preventing-type-2-diabetes">prevent type 2 diabetes</a> by knowing the risk factors and taking steps toward a healthier lifestyle, such as losing weight or preventing weight gain.</p>

<h class="h4">Gestational diabetes
</h>
<p class="explainp">
Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a higher chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is type 2 diabetes.
</p>

<h class="h4">
    Prediabetes

</h>
<p class="explainp">
    People with <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/what-is-diabetes/prediabetes-insulin-resistance">prediabetes</a> have blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. You also have a higher risk for heart disease than people with normal glucose levels.

<h class="h4">
    Diabetes and exercise
</h>
<p class="explainp">

Along with diet and treatment, exercise plays an essential role in diabetes management. This is true for all types of diabetes.

Staying active helps your cells react to insulin more effectively and lower your blood sugar levels. Exercising regularly can also help you:
 reach and maintain a healthy weight,
 reduce your risk of diabetes-related health complications,
 boost mood, 
 get 
 <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/17-tips-to-sleep-better"> better sleep</a> and
 <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/ways-to-improve-memory">improve memory.</a>

If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, general guidance is to aim for at least <a href="https://www.diabetes.org/healthy-living/fitness">150 minutes</a> of moderate-intensity exercise each week. There are currently no separate exercise guidelines for people who have gestational diabetes. But if you’re pregnant, start out slowly and gradually increase your activity level over time to avoid overdoing it.

<li>Get at least 150 minutes per week of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/benefits-of-aerobic-exercise">aerobic exercises</a> like walking or cycling.</li>
