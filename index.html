       <p class="description">Garlic health benefits are due to the formation of sulfur compound when you chop, crush or chew a garlic clover. Perhaps the most well known compound is allicin. However, it is unstable compound that is only briefly present in fresh garlic after you cut or crush it.Other compounds include <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8570849/">diallyl disulfide</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014299916307658">s-ally cysteine.</a>

             </p>
             <p class=" explainp">Much of garlic’s therapeutic acclaim is down to an active compound called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073756/">allicin.</a> This sulphur-containing compound gives garlic its pungent smell and distinctive taste. Luckily for us cooks, the action of chopping or crushing stimulates the production of allicin. But it is thought that the application of heat may inhibit some of the perceived medicinal properties, making it best to add garlic late in the cooking process.</p>  <br>

Chronic inflammation can harm your immunity by reducing your white blood cell count. Studies investigating the effects of garlic extract have found that it helps reduce systemic inflammation and restore white blood cell levels, per a 2021 review in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8259612/">Journal of Clinical and Translational Research</a>. This is largely thanks to allicin, a sulphur-containing compound found in allium foods like onions, chives and garlic.

7. Garlic may improve your athletic performance

                       <p class="explainp">

Garlic was one of the earliest “performance-enhancing” substances.

Ancient civilizations used garlic to reduce fatigue and improve the work capacity of laborers. Olympic athletes in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11238795/">ancient Greece</a> consumed garlic to improve their performance.

While <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31339799/">rodent studies</a> have shown that garlic helps with exercise performance, there have been very few human studies.

A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0944711318301557">recent study</a> found that garlic didn’t improve cyclists’ performance in a 40-km time trial. However, it may have reduced exercise-related oxidative stress and muscle damage.

A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4446086/">small 2015 study</a> also noted that garlic supplements might increase oxygen capacity during exercise. But more research is needed to confirm this potential benefit.

At high doses, the sulfur compounds in garlic have been shown to protect against organ damage from <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heavy-metal-poisoning">heavy metal toxicity.</a>

Allicin in garlic can help <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-020-07654-2">reduce levels of lead</a> in your blood and vital organs.

A 2012 study involving employees at a car battery plant (who had excessive exposure to lead) found that garlic reduced lead levels in the blood by 19%. It also reduced many clinical signs of toxicity, including headaches and high blood pressure.

Three doses of garlic each day even outperformed the drug D-penicillamine in reducing symptoms.

A few recent studies have measured the effects of garlic on bone health, specifically in women after menopause.

Results of a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5783112/">clinical trial</a> published in 2017 showed that garlic can reduce oxidative stress that leads to osteoporosis. The participants took garlic tablets equal to about 2 grams of fresh garlic per day.

              The ten minute garlic rule typically refers to how long you should let garlic stand after cutting or crushing it before you cook it. This <a href="https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/food-beverages/garlic">may contain</a> some of the allicin, a beneficial but unstable compound that degrades when fresh garlic is heated. Eating raw garlic may provide additional benefits as some of the beneficial compounds in garlic are sensitive to heat.
