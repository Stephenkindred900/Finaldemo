            Curcumin is the active ingredient in turmeric, and it has powerful biological properties. Ayurvedic medicine, a traditional Indian system of treatment, recommends turmeric for a variety of health conditions. These include chronic pain and inflammation. Western medicine has begun to study turmeric as a pain reliever and healing agent.<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7522354/"> Research</a> has shown that turmeric contains compounds with medicinal properties.

         <p class="benefitsh">Health Benefits</p>
         <p class="benefitsph">1. Turmeric contains bioactive compounds with medicinal properties</p>
        <p  class="explainp">
It has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031">powerful anti-inflammatory effects</a> and is a very strong antioxidant. That said, the curcumin content of turmeric is only around 1-6% by weight.

In addition, curcumin is poorly absorbed into your bloodstream. In order to experience the full effects of curcumin, its <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770259/"> bioavailability</a> (the rate at which your body absorbs a substance) needs to improve.

It helps to consume it with <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/turmeric-and-black-pepper">black pepper</a>, which contains piperine. Piperine is a natural substance that enhances the absorption of curcumin by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/">2,000%.</a>

In fact, the best curcumin supplements contain piperine, and this makes them substantially more effective.

Curcumin is also fat soluble, which means it breaks down and dissolves in fat or oil. That’s why it may be a good idea to take curcumin supplements with a meal that’s high in fat.</p><br>

            2. Curcumin is a natural anti-inflammatory compound  
       </p> 
       <p class="explainp">
           Curcumin is a bioactive substance that can help fight <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6636482/">inflammation</a>, though very high doses are required to produce medicinal results.

Still, it means it has the potential to fight the inflammation that plays a role in many <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/inflammation">health conditions and diseases</a>.

That’s why anything that can help fight chronic inflammation is potentially important in preventing and helping treat these conditions.

 3. Turmeric can increase the antioxidant capacity of the body           
       </p> 
       <p class="explainp">
   
Oxidative damage is believed to be one of the mechanisms behind aging and many diseases.

It involves free radicals, highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons. Free radicals tend to react with important organic substances, such as fatty acids, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/is-too-much-protein-bad-for-you">proteins</a>, or DNA.

Curcumin is a potent antioxidant that can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33172016/">neutralize free radicals</a> due to its chemical structure.

In addition, animal and cellular studiesTrusted Source suggest that curcumin may block the action of free radicals and may stimulate the action of other antioxidants. Further clinical studies are needed in humans to confirm these benefits.

        <p class="benefitsph">
5. Curcumin may lower your risk of heart disease           
       </p> 
       <p class="explainp">


Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the world. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28274852/">Research</a> suggests that curcumin may help protect against many steps in the heart disease process.

Specifically, it helps improve the function of the endothelium or the lining of your blood vessels.

Endothelial dysfunction is a major driver of heart disease. This is when your endothelium is unable to regulate blood pressure, blood clotting, and various other factors.

<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/3/746/htm">Several other studies</a> also suggest that curcumin can lead to improvements in heart health. In addition, curcumin can help reduce inflammation and oxidation (as discussed above), which can play a role in heart disease.

        <p class="benefitsph">
6. Turmeric may help prevent cancer           
       </p> 
       <p class="explainp">
Many different forms of cancer appear to be affected by curcumin supplements.

In fact, curcumin has been studied as a beneficial herb in cancer treatment and has been found to affect cancer growth and development.

<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212429218303948?via%3Dihub">Studies</a> have shown that it can:

contribute to the death of cancerous cells
reduce angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels in tumors)
reduce metastasis (spread of cancer)
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6835707/">There is also evidence</a> that curcumin may <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/cancer-fighting-foods">prevent cancer</a> from occurring in the first place, especially cancers of the digestive system like colorectal cancer.
